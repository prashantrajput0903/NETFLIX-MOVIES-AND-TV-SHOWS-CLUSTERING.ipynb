# NETFLIX-MOVIES-AND-TV-SHOWS-CLUSTERING
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flexible which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

#Model Prediction
In this project, I used some the tools such as Text processing, and K-Means Clustering algorithms to get insights from the dataset. And also used some validation techniques to check the accuracy of the model for example Silhouette Score, and Elbow Method.

Conclusion
My model is working well at the n_clusters = 3 which is 0.355.
